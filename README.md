# Daydacna

Daydacna is a Jupyter Notebook to evaluate daily cycles in geochemical data (here elemental ratios measured within Tridacna giant clam shells) 
by using continuous wavelet transform. This script creates an internal age model for the shell (with manual adjustment options) and converts the 
data from distance to time domain. It's a useful approach if you want to learn something about the seasonality of the shell. 

If your interested, please check out the accompanying open access paper:

## Status

I'm happy that it works but much is to be done. 
The next planned step is to create a streamlit page where everyone can play around with their data without having to be knowledgeable in python.
I plan to make the script more widely applicable to analyse cyclicities other than daily by implementing adaptable units.
